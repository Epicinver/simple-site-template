This is a template for if you want a clean, modern website. I've used this template in Text2Hex's website, my own website, and just for fun! I am really excited to publish this template!

# How to use

Go into the redirect(s).html and change the link to the redirects. Go into the index.html and edit other.html, differpage.html and otherpage.html and edit the text and buttons.
Open in a browser.

# How to publish online with GitHub Pages

First, make a repository called "YourGHUsername.github.io" and put all the files inside of the repo EXCEPT this file. Go to https://YourGHUsername.github.io, and refresh until the
deployments have finished.
To add a custom domain, add a DNS record to verify with GitHub.
